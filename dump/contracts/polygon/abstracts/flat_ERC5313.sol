    *
    * @dev Because this specification does not extend EIP-165, calling this
    *      EIP's { owner } function cannot result in complete certainty that
    *      the result is indeed the owner. For example, another function with
    *      the same function signature may return some value that is then
    *      interpreted to be the true owner. If this EIP is used solely to
    *      identify if an account is the owner of a contract, then the impact
    *      of this risk is minimized. But if the interrogator is, for example,
    *      sending a valuable NFT to the identified owner of any contract on
    *      the network, then the risk is heightened.
