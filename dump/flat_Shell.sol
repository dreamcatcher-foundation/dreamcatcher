* @dev The shell is meant to be inherited by the implementation. This is

*      storage clashes as the shell's storage is directly inherited
*      by the node. It also disabled external functions from the node
*      to reduce attack surfaces as these functions should not be
*      called and cannot be called by the shell anyway.
*
* NOTE In Shell all node external functions are disabled. These will
*      be called on the node during a call therefore to reduce
*      exposure and attack vectors these are not to be used. The
*      internal functions can still be used as required.
*
* STANDARD When creating an implementation with shell prefix it as
*          sl ie. slToken. Ensure not to declare any additional
*          variables within an sl contract. These should be able to
*          be used interchangably with any node.
