Using this library instead of the unchecked operations eliminates an entire class of bugs, so it's recommended to use it always.",

No guarantees are made on the ordering. ```solidity contract Example {     // Add the library methods     using EnumerableMap for EnumerableMap.UintToAddressMap;     // Declare a set state variable     EnumerableMap.UintToAddressMap private myMap; } ``` The following map types are supported: - `uint256 -> address` (`UintToAddressMap`) since v3.0.0 - `address -> uint256` (`AddressToUintMap`) since v4.6.0 - `bytes32 -> bytes32` (`Bytes32ToBytes32Map`) since v4.6.0 - `uint256 -> uint256` (`UintToUintMap`) since v4.7.0 - `bytes32 -> uint256` (`Bytes32ToUintMap`) since v4.7.0 [WARNING] ==== Trying to delete such a structure from storage will likely result in data corruption, rendering the structure unusable. See https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11843[ethereum/solidity#11843] for more info. In order to clean an EnumerableMap, you can either remove all elements one by one or create a fresh instance using an array of EnumerableMap. ====",
