Using this library instead of the unchecked operations eliminates an entire class of bugs, so it's recommended to use it always.",

No guarantees are made on the ordering. ```solidity contract Example {     // Add the library methods     using EnumerableMap for EnumerableMap.UintToAddressMap;     // Declare a set state variable     EnumerableMap.UintToAddressMap private myMap; } ``` The following map types are supported: - `uint256 -> address` (`UintToAddressMap`) since v3.0.0 - `address -> uint256` (`AddressToUintMap`) since v4.6.0 - `bytes32 -> bytes32` (`Bytes32ToBytes32Map`) since v4.6.0 - `uint256 -> uint256` (`UintToUintMap`) since v4.7.0 - `bytes32 -> uint256` (`Bytes32ToUintMap`) since v4.7.0 [WARNING] ==== Trying to delete such a structure from storage will likely result in data corruption, rendering the structure unusable. See https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11843[ethereum/solidity#11843] for more info. In order to clean an EnumerableMap, you can either remove all elements one by one or create a fresh instance using an array of EnumerableMap. ====",

Sets have the following properties: - Elements are added, removed, and checked for existence in constant time (O(1)). - Elements are enumerated in O(n). No guarantees are made on the ordering. ```solidity contract Example {     // Add the library methods     using EnumerableSet for EnumerableSet.AddressSet;     // Declare a set state variable     EnumerableSet.AddressSet private mySet; } ``` As of v3.3.0, sets of type `bytes32` (`Bytes32Set`), `address` (`AddressSet`) and `uint256` (`UintSet`) are supported. [WARNING] ==== Trying to delete such a structure from storage will likely result in data corruption, rendering the structure unusable. See https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11843[ethereum/solidity#11843] for more info. In order to clean an EnumerableSet, you can either remove all elements one by one or create a fresh instance using an array of EnumerableSet. ====\",\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"contracts/polygon/external/openzeppelin/utils/structs/EnumerableSet.sol\":\"EnumerableSet\"},\"evmVersion\":\"paris\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"contracts/polygon/external/openzeppelin/utils/structs/EnumerableSet.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xeefcbb8cb69f04a18f6dc61d4811133ce9aeff96ce60820f758abc52ef55b892\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://81c61c0dd40890f6a4b1fb792bc5b5b61e821fcafa2aae6c7eda6d4f1ece2593\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmRLMrq6BiPS9wGu7ZC174SFYWCu6cxbU3agDw2XgJeDpT\"]}},\"version\":1}",
