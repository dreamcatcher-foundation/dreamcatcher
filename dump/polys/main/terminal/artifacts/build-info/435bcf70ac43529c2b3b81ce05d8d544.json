No guarantees are made on the ordering. ```solidity contract Example {     // Add the library methods     using EnumerableSet for EnumerableSet.AddressSet;     // Declare a set state variable     EnumerableSet.AddressSet private mySet; } ``` As of v3.3.0, sets of type `bytes32` (`Bytes32Set`), `address` (`AddressSet`) and `uint256` (`UintSet`) are supported.

See https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11843[ethereum/solidity#11843] for more info.

No guarantees are made on the ordering.\n ```solidity\n contract Example {\n     // Add the library methods\n     using EnumerableSet for EnumerableSet.AddressSet;\n     // Declare a set state variable\n     EnumerableSet.AddressSet private mySet;\n }\n ```\n As of v3.3.0, sets of type `bytes32` (`Bytes32Set`), `address` (`AddressSet`)\n and `uint256` (`UintSet`) are supported.\n [WARNING]\n ====\n Trying to delete such a structure from storage will likely result in data corruption, rendering the structure\n unusable.\n See https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11843[ethereum/solidity#11843] for more info.\n In order to clean an EnumerableSet, you can either remove all elements one by one or create a fresh instance using an\n array of EnumerableSet.\n ===="
