Slides are built to be passed or mounted as children on pages. They are build as to fit the viewport. You can stack them vertically to the right and horizontally to the bottom using the respective page types. The layer slide is designed to be a direct child of the default slide. They stack on the z axis on of each other which allows for different layers to be put together,
