In the decentralized ecosystem, the versatility of 
diamond contracts lies in their modular nature, 
allowing for the assembly of distinct facets to construct 
specialized decentralized applications. However, the 
applicability of facets varies depending on the intended use 
case or diamond model. For example, an ERC20 token diamond 
model may require facets tailored to token issuance and 
transfer, while a decentralized finance (DeFi) diamond model 
may necessitate additional facets for lending and borrowing 
protocols. This model-based approach offers developers the 
flexibility to customize diamond contracts to suit specific 
requirements, optimizing functionality and enhancing user 
experience. Looking ahead, the concept of modular facets paves 
the way for a decentralized marketplace where developers can 
access and integrate pre-built facets and code components, 
akin to an app store for smart contracts, fostering innovation 
and collaboration within the decentralized ecosystem.
